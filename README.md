# Frequency-dependent selection in timeseries data, analysis
  
This repository contains code and data to reproduce the results and figures of
Newberry and Plotkin (2022) _Measuring frequency-dependent selection in
culture_.

## Dependencies

The analysis relies on the software `fdsel`, available in a separate repository
and R (3.6.1) with packages optparse and ggplot2, as well as a typical unix
environment.

The binaries `fdsel` and `fdsel-simdemo` (for Fig. S6) are required to be in
the path.

## Name analysis

The name analysis is in the `names` subdirectory. Executing `./run.sh` and
`Rscript plot.R` reproduces the analysis.

## Dog popularity analysis

The dog popularity analysis is in the `akc` subdirectory. Executing `./run.sh`
and `Rscript plot.R` reproduces most of the analysis.

The novelty bias grid search (SI Section 5) is extremely computationally
intensive and takes days to execute. To run this analysis, uncomment the
relevant lines from `run.sh`.
